# Roadmap
The following roadmap is an idea. Therefore, the priority might change, and we might implement a feature earlier or later depending on customer projects and other circumstances.  

### More YouTube Videos to Explain New Features
We plan to create a short series of YouTube videos to explain and demonstrate new features and their uses.

### MQTT Analysis and Integration
We aim to add the capability for our sending devices to use MQTT. Ideally, the PressureSuite Cloud backend will be able to accept and communicate using MQTT.

### Export of Multiple Channels into One Excel/CSV File
Enable the export of data from multiple channels into a single Excel/CSV file.

### *Find*, *Mark*, and *Delete* Unreliable or Outlier Data
Use statistical methods and customized thresholds to identify irregularities. Users should be able to mark and delete found unreliable data.

### Helper Formulas and Forms for Installing a Level Probe, Even When the Borehole Is Not Vertical
In conjunction with PressureSuite Desktop, we want to simplify the process of installing a level probe and the sending unit until the first transmission. This includes special cases where a borehole is not vertical, requiring compensation with a formula that accounts for the angle difference.
