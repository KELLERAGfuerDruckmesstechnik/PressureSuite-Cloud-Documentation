# LoRa Partner

## LoRa Network Server

### The Things Network (TTN)

<https://www.thethingsnetwork.org>
*"The Things Network (TTN) is a community-based initiative for the establishment of an energy-saving wide-range network for the Internet of Things. In June 2019 TTN covered large areas with around 12,000 installed LoRaWAN gateways in around 135 countries. Volunteers are responsible for the provision, construction and maintenance of gateways. These gateways transmit long-range radio signals from energy-saving sensors via the Internet to a control centre. There the signals (e.g. measurement data from water meters) are further processed and forwarded to defined receivers. There is AES 128 end-to-end encryption, which increases data security.
In Amsterdam, this has made it possible to cover large parts of the city area in less than six weeks. Most of the Netherlands is already covered by TTN. The same applies to Zurich, Bern and Berlin. In Berlin, it took approximately 17 months to provide around 3,500,000 people with LoRaWAN access with over 75 registered gateways. Currently, around 120 gateways are registered in Berlin.
In June 2019, around 75,000 volunteers around the world were involved in setting up the world's largest networked "Internet of Things", in which more than 15 million data records are processed every day."*

### Loriot.io

<https://www.loriot.io/>  
*"Our geographically distributed LoRaWAN cloud is providing low-latency access to your gateways, back-ends and users world-wide. Since 2015, it has been delivering convincing, responsive IoT proof-of-concept (PoC) projects for our customers in more than 70 countries. It has significantly reduced their development effort and shortened time to market."*

## Mobile Communication Companies using LoRa

There are 121 Network operators in 58 countries providing LoRa Networks.
See <https://lora-alliance.org/>  
76 are LoRaWAN Public Network Operators and some of them are Mobile Communication Companies offering LoRaWAN antennas.

### Here are some examples

#### Example Switzerland: Swisscom

<https://lpn.swisscom.ch>  
*"The Swisscom LPN currently covers 96.7% of the Swiss population. The information contained in this map is based on network coverage simulations, so small variations in coverage may occur. Map dated 14 June 2019."*

#### Example Finland: Digita

<https://www.digita.fi/en/services/iot>  
<https://www.digita.fi/en/services/iot/iot_lorawan_network_coverage_map>  
*"Using Digita's nationwide covering LPWA(Low Power Wide Area), LoRa is next-generation’s radio technology that has been especially designed to meet the needs of IoT. [..] For many customers of Digita, it is crucial to develop IoT-services without complicated local network or gateway solutions in properties. "*
