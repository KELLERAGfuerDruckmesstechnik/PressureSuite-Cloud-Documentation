## Water Level Calculation

There are essentially 3 different calculation types.

![Watercalculation Wizard](../../LoRa_WizardWaterCalc1.png  "Watercalculation Wizard")

### Height Of Water

At water height above probe (E), the water column/water height above the probe is measured.

### Depth To Water

At depth to water (F), the distance from the upper edge of the measuring point to the water surface is determined. For 
the calculation of the depth upper edge of the measuring point to the water surface, the installation length B must be 
known.

### Height Of Water Above Sea Level

At water level related to sea level (G) the water level/water level related to sea level is calculated. With this infor-
mation, the measured values from different locations can be compared with each other. For this calculation, the 
installation length B and the height above sea level of the upper edge of the measuring point are required.
