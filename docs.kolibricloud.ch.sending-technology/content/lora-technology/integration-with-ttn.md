description: Information on how to integrate a configured KELLER LoRa device to the TTN platform
---
## Preface
All LoRaWAN devices are already enlisted in a KELLER TTN account. If you do not want to claim ownership over the TTN communication and just want to see the data on the KOLIBRI Cloud, then you can go to Step 2 and program the device according your use case (measure/send interval) and update the device time. After this you can skip all steps until Step 10.
Nevertheless, we recommend to overtake the ownership of the device in TTN and re-program the App EUI / App Key and enlist the device in an own application.

## 'Add a New Device to your TTN V3'-Guide

### What you need

- An account on 'The Things Network'. If you do not have one than please sign up on https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/
- A KELLER LoRa device (ADT1 LoRa or ARC1 LoRa)
- [GSM setup tool](https://keller-druck.com/en/products/software/desktop-applications/gsm-setup-for-remote-transmission-units) and a USB connector cable (ARC1: K114 interface converter / ADT1: Micro USB cable)
- The Device EUI number of the device (Use the [GSM setup tool](https://keller-druck.com/en/products/software/desktop-applications/gsm-setup-for-remote-transmission-units) to extract the EUI)
- The Application EUI number of the device (Use the [GSM setup tool](https://keller-druck.com/en/products/software/desktop-applications/gsm-setup-for-remote-transmission-units) to extract the EUI)
- The KOLIBRI Endpoint URL which is: `https://devspakellercloudfunctionapp.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpTriggerCSharp_PascalTTN?code=eQxVYd76shpatS8av6lzsn3XxNEbtCiE9psrJaasyeMk/fudmQQ5uw==`

### Step 1

- During the order of the device ask your sales person to let the device pre-configure by the KOLIBRI support team. This helps to speed up and simplify your configuration work. Technical documentation for the configuration of a KELLER LoRa-device can be found [here](https://docs.pressuresuite.com/sending-technology/lora-technology/update-keller-lora-device).

### Step 2

- Connect your PC using the [GSM setup tool](https://keller-druck.com/en/products/software/desktop-applications/gsm-setup-for-remote-transmission-units) and 
  - Program your device according to your use case (See [How to configure a LoRaWAN device](https://docs.pressuresuite.com/sending-technology/lora-technology/update-keller-lora-device/))  
  - Do not forget to re-program the 'App EUI' and 'App Key' as the device is already enlisted in a KELLER TTN account. With the re-programming of the 'App EUI' and 'App Key' you have the complete ownership of the device and its transmission.
  - Write down the 'Application EUI', 'App Key' and the 'Device EUI'

### Step 8

- If you have a TTN gateway in reach, you should now be able to communicate with the TTN server.
- When you want to register a new TTN gateway into TTN then go to https://eu1.cloud.thethings.network/console/gateways/add
  - Enter the **Gateway EUI** from the Gateway and choose a **Gateway ID**
  - Use the same *frequency plan* and set the *Gateway Status* to **Public**
  - Ensure that your gateway's communication is not blocked by your or your company's IT firewall.

### Step 9

- To send data to the KOLIBRI Cloud it is needed to forward the transmissions.
  - Go to **Integrations** and **+Add Webhook** in **Webhooks**
  - Choose **Custom webhook**
  - Choose a *Webhook ID* such as *webhook-to-kolibri*
  - *Webhook format* is **JSON**
  - *Base URL* is `https://devspakellercloudfunctionapp.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpTriggerCSharp_PascalTTN?code=eQxVYd76shpatS8av6lzsn3XxNEbtCiE9psrJaasyeMk/fudmQQ5uw==`  
  - Enable all **Uplink messages**
  - Press **Add webhook**.  
  This will forward a transmission to the KOLIBRI Cloud.
