## Create PressureSuite account: Two step verification

- Fill the form with your data

- Example: 
```
Username : KristerHulten
* New Password: Cleanwater@42
* Confirm New password: Cleanwater@42
Email Address: k.hulten@keller-rocks.now
```

- Click on the [Send verification] and look in your
mailbox and verify the mail. If you don’t find the mail then either you entered the wrong mail or your email provider has blocked the mail.

```
* Password credentials:
8 - 16 characters, containing 3 out of 4 of the
following: Lowercase characters, uppercase
characters, digits (0-9), and one or more of
the following symbols: @ # $ % ^ & * - _ + =
[ ] { } | \ : ' ,? / ` ~ " ( ) ;
```

- Next step will be to contact your PressureSuite Cloud Support team to add you to your group and give you Administrator Rights (***CustomerAdmin***).

## If your company already has a Customer Administrator
- Send the Username (only username NO password should be sent) to your CustomerAdmin.

- The CustomerAdmin then uses the “Admin Settings” and just write the chosen username in the box for “Add New Registered User” and press “Add user”.

- Then it will take a couple of minutes to update the database before the new user can access the PressureSuite Cloud.

- You can always reach our PressureSuite Cloud Support by mailing your ordinary contact or send a mail to: pressuresuite@keller-pressure.com
