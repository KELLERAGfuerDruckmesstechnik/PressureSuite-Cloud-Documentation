# Roadmap
The following roadmap is an idea. Therefore, the priority might change, and we might implement a feature earlier or later depending on customer projects and other circumstances. 

### More YouTube videos to explain new features
It is planned to have a short series of YouTube videos explaining and demonstrating new features and their uses.

### MQTT analysis and integration
We are going to add the possibility to use MQTT in our sending devices. Ideally, the KOLIBRI Cloud backend shall be able to accept and communicate with MQTT. 

### Export of multiple channels into ONE Excel/CSV file
Export of multiple channels into ONE Excel/CSV file.

### *Find*, *mark* and *delete* unreliable or outlier data
Statistical methods and customized threshold should make it possible to find irregularities.  
Found unreliable data should be able to be marked and even deleted.

### DeviceConfiguration for LoRa devices
Now that the sending 'Device Configuration' for GSM/ARC to devices over FTP/Mail-server is working. We are going to implement the new protocol for KELLER's LoRa devices. The goal is to communicate to and from the device over multiple LoRaWAN transmission using the small payload efficiently.
