## Temporary Access Token

If you want to try out the API with [Swagger](https://api.pressuresuite.com/swagger/index.html?url=/swagger/v1/swagger.json) please us the dark green [Authorize] button and a valid bearer token.  
![BearerToken From Swagger UI](../img/BearerTokenFromSwaggerUI.png)

You can get a valid bearer token when logged in on <https://www.pressuresuite.com> under [User Settings]  
![BearerToken From Web App](../img/BearerTokenFromWebApp.png)

## Permanent Access Token
If you want a *Permanent Access Token*: One user of a customer group has the "CustomerAdmin" rights. This user can get the permanent access token from the web app from https://www.pressuresuite.com/account-settings.  
The provided access token must be the value with the key "userOid" in the header of every request. This way a bearer token and the OAUTH flow is NOT needed anymore.
