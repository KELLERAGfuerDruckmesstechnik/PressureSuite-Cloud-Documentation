# What are the differences between GSM2Datamanager and KOLIBRI Cloud

Basically prefer to use the KOLIBRI Cloud as it is easier, modern and well supported.

The reasons to use the Datamanager are:

- You are bound to rules that do not allow to use any cloud services (such as Dropbox, Windows 10)
- You are bound to rules that do not allow to have the data stored in another country
- Accessability of 98% is not enough
- You change the location of the device in a regular basis
